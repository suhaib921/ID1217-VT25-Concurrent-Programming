8. The Unisex Bathroom Problem  (40 points)
Suppose there is only one bathroom in a building. Any number of men or women can use it, but not simultaneously.
Develop a monitor to synchronize the use of the bathroom. The monitor has four public procedures: manEnter, manExit, womanEnter, and womanExit. A man process calls manEnter to get permission to use the bathroom and calls manExit when finished. A woman process calls womanEnter and womanExit. Use the Signal and Continue signaling discipline (the default discipline). Your solution has to ensure the required exclusion and avoid deadlock, and ensure fairness, i.e., ensure that any person (man or woman) who is waiting to enter the bathroom eventually gets to do so
Implement a multithreaded application in Java or C++ to simulate the actions of the "man" and "woman" processes represented as concurrent threads and the bathroom represented as the developed monitor. The output from your program should be a trace of significant events, such as a person wanting to enter the bathroom or exiting the room. Each line of output should contain a time stamp, the identity of the person associated with the event, and a short descriptive message. Write the trace to the standard output.
