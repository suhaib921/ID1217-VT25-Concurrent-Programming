# Question 4
4. Yet Another Dining Philosophers problem [Dining in Hell]  (40 points) adapted from "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" by Maurice Herlihy and Nir Shavit
In Dante's Inferno, he describes a visit to Hell. In a recently discovered chapter, he encounters five people sitting at a table with a pot of stew in the middle. Although each one holds a spoon that reaches the pot, each spoon's handle is much longer than each person's arm so that no one can feed him- or herself. They are hungry and desperate. Dante then suggests, "why do not you feed one another?" The rest of the chapter is lost.
Develop an algorithm to allow these five unfortunates to feed one another. Two or more people may not feed the same person simultaneously. Your algorithm must be, well, starvation-free. Write a multithreaded program in Java or C++ to simulate the above problem using threads representing the five unfortunates and a shared concurrent object(s) to synchronize the threads so they can "feed" one another. The object(s) can be developed as a monitor (i.e., synchronized objects). Your program should print a trace of the interesting events in the program.
