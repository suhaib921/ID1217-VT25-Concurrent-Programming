# Question 4
4. Determine all common values in three arrays. A.k.a. The Welfare Crook problem (by Prof. D. Gries) (40 points)
Assume there are three distributed processes: F, G, and H, each having a local array of strings (or integers): f[1:n], g[1:n], and h[1:n], respectively. Assume that the first array f[1:n] is a list that contains names (or personal numbers) of people working at IBM Yorktown,  the second g[1:n] is a list of students at Columbia, and the third h[1:n] is a list of people on welfare in New York City. Assume that there is at least one person whose name is on all three lists. [ One can think that something peculiar is going on if the person's name is on all three lists! ].

Develop and implement a distributed program in which all three processes interact with each other until each process has determined all names, each of which is on all three lists. Each process prints the common names that it has determined. Use message passing (or RMI) for interaction between the processes; do not use shared variables. Messages may contain only one value at a time and (if needed) process ids. Do not send entire arrays in messages (or RMI calls) because the arrays can be huge. You can implement your distributed application in C using the MPI library or in Java using the socket API or Java RMI. In comments in the program or a README file, explain your solution (algorithm) shortly.
