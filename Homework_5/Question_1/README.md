# Question 1
1. Distributed Pairing 1 (a client-server application) (20 points)
Assume that a class has n students numbered 1 to n and one teacher. The teacher wants to assign the students to groups of two for a project. The teacher does so by having every student submit a request for a partner. The teacher takes the first two requests, forms a group from those students, and lets each student know their partner. The teacher then takes the following two requests, forms a second group, and so on. If n is odd, the last student "partners" with themself.

Model the students as client processes and the teacher as a server process. Develop and implement a distributed client-server application that includes the server (teacher) and clients (students). When your application terminates, each student process should print their index (a number or a name) and the index (a number or a name) of the student's partner. You can implement your distributed application in C using the MPI library or Java using the Java socket API or Java RMI. Your application must be distributed. In comments in the program or a README file, explain your solution (algorithm) shortly.
