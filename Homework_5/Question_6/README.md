# Question 6
6. Exchanging Values (40 points)
Consider the three program outlines (algorithms) in Lecture 15, slides 28-34, for exchanging values by interactive peers. Implement each algorithm in C using the MPI library or in Java using the socket API or Java RMI. You may use collective communication (or multicast in Java) where appropriate. Each program should execute a sequence of R rounds of exchanges. Your program should print a trace of the interesting events as they happen, but do not make the trace too verbose. Estimate and compare the performance of your programs. Build a plot that shows the total execution time of each program as a function of the number of processes (2, 4, 6, 8) and the number of rounds (1, 2, 3). When performing evaluation experiments, do not print a trace of events.
