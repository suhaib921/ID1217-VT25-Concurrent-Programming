# Question 4
4. The 8-queens problem (40 points)
The 8-queens problem is concerned with placing 8 queens on a chess board in such a way that no one queen can attack another. One can attack another if both are in the same row or column or are on the same diagonal. Develop a parallel program (in C/C++ using OpenMP) to generate all 92 solutions to the 8-queens problem. [Hint: You can use tasks so that the master thread recursively generates queen placements and other tasks to check whether  placements are acceptable.]

Run the program on different numbers of processors and report the speedup (sequential execution time divided by parallel execution time) for different numbers of processors (up to at least 4). Run each program several (at least 5) times and use the median value for execution time. Try to provide reasonable explanations for your results. Measure only the parallel part of your program. Specify the number of processors used by specifying a different number of threads (set the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable or use a call to omp_set_num_threads(), see the OpenMP specification). To measure the execution time, use the omp_get_wtime function (see omp_get_wtimeLinks to an external site.).
