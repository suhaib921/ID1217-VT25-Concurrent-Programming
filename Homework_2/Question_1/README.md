# Question 1
1. Compute the Sum, Min, and Max of Matrix Elements (20 points)
The purpose of this problem is to introduce you to basic OpenMP usage:
Download, compile, and run a program matrixSum-openmp.c Download matrixSum-openmp.c. The program computes a sum of matrix elements in parallel using OpenMP. Develop and evaluate the following modified version of the program.
Extend the program so that in addition to the sum, it finds and prints a value and a position (indexes) of the maximum element of the matrix and a value and a position of the minimum element of the matrix. To check your solution, initialize elements of the matrix to random values. Use OpenMP constructs. Run the program on different numbers of processors and report the speedup (sequential execution time divided by parallel execution time) for different numbers of processors (up to at least 4) and different sizes of matrices (at least 3 different sizes). Run each program several (at least 5) times and use the median value for execution time. Try to provide reasonable explanations for your results. Measure only the parallel part of your program. Specify the number of processors used by specifying a different number of threads (set the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable or use a call to omp_set_num_threads(), see the OpenMP specification). To measure the execution time, use the omp_get_wtime function (see omp_get_wtimeLinks to an external site.).
