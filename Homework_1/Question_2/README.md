# Question 2
2. Quicksort (20 points)
The quicksort algorithm sorts the list of numbers by first dividing the list into two sublists so that all the numbers if one sublist are smaller than all the numbers in the other sublist. This is done by selecting one number (called a pivot) against which all other numbers are compared: the numbers which are less than the pivot are placed in one sublist, and the numbers which more than the pivot are placed in another sublist. The pivot can be either placed in one sublist or withheld and placed in its final position. Develop a parallel multithreaded program (in C using Pthreads or in Java) with recursive parallelism that implements the quicksort algorithm for sorting an array of n values. Performance evaluation: Measure and print also the execution time of your program using the timesLinks to an external site. function or the gettimeofdayLinks to an external site. function (see how it is done in matrixSum.c Download matrixSum.c.). To calculate the execution time, read the clock after initializing all variables and just before creating the threads. Read the clock again after the computation is complete and the worker threads have terminated.
