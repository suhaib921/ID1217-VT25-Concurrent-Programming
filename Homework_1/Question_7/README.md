# Question 7
7. The 8-queens problem (40 points)
The 8-queens problem is concerned with placing 8 queens on a chess board in such a way that no one queen can attack another. One can attack another if both are in the same row or column or are on the same diagonal. Develop a parallel multithreaded program (in C using Pthreads or Java) to generate all 92 solutions to the 8-queens problem. [Hint: You may develop a pipeline so that one thread (i.e., the main thread) uses a recursive procedure to generate queen placements, and several worker threads execute a procedure to check whether placements are acceptable.]
Performance evaluation: Measure and print also the execution time of your program using the timesLinks to an external site. function or the gettimeofdayLinks to an external site. function (see how it is done in matrixSum.c Download matrixSum.c.). To calculate the execution time, read the clock after initializing all variables and just before creating the threads. Read the clock again after the computation is complete and the worker threads have terminated.
